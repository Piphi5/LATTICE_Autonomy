# Shuttle Modeling

To get a better understanding of the dynamics of the shuttle, we have implemented simulations, free-body diagrams, and corresponding graphs to better understand how the shuttle will behave.

For some derivations of some of the major physics behind the shuttle there is this [latex document](https://www.overleaf.com/read/kghkvywmkyfj).
For more detail on the state space model implementation there is the [confluence page](https://lattice22.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/L/pages/43352125/Shuttle+Model).
